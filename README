# UNIX sensors (tingle)

# Query CPU, memory, network, power, audio and
  temperature sensors.

Supporting Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS and DragonFlyBSD.

It's also probably a useful reference for querying common
system information on the most-common Unix-like operating
systems.

This can be used with pipes by other processes to
query the hardware. Or just to display a status
line in screen or tmux or some Xorg program.

Install:
	make (or gmake)

   Where OPTIONS can be a combination of
      -c
